## 1. Introduction to ACTRIS and The ACTRIS Data Centre

The Research Infrastructure (RI) ACTRIS – Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace Gases is the pan-European RI that consolidates activities amongst European partners for observations of aerosols, clouds, and trace gases and for understanding of the related atmospheric processes, as well as to provide RI services to wide user groups. ACTRIS is a unique research infrastructure improving the quality of atmospheric observations, developing new methods and protocols, and harmonizing existing observations of the atmospheric variables listed in Appendix 1.

The ACTRIS Data Managment Plan follow the [glossary](https://www.actris.eu/About/ACTRIS/ACTRISglossary.aspx) of terminology and definitions used in ACTRIS.

The overall goal of the ACTRIS Data Centre is to provide scientists and other user groups with free and open access to all ACTRIS infrastructure data, complemented with access to innovative and mature data products, together with tools for quality assurance (QA), data analysis and research, following the [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples). The numerous measurement methodologies applied in ACTRIS result in a considerable diversity of the data collected. In accordance with these requirements, the ACTRIS Data Centre will be organized in 6 Units, with clear links and procedures for interaction between the data centre Units, National Facilities (NFs) and topical centres (TCs). The ACTRIS DC will be coordinated by the ACCESS unit leader and all data is linked through the [ACTRIS data portal](http://actris.nilu.no/) to provide a single access point to all data and related information. The units are:

* [ACTRIS In situ data centre unit (In-Situ)](http://ebas.nilu.no/)
* [ACTRIS Aerosol remote sensing data centre unit (ARES)](http://access.earlinet.org/EARLINET/)
* [ACTRIS Cloud remote sensing data centre unit (CLU)](http://cloudnet.fmi.fi/)
* ACTRIS trace gases remote sensing data centre unit (GRES)
* [ACTRIS Atmospheric simulation chamber data centre unit (ASC)](https://data.eurochamp.org/)

*Figure 1: Architecture of the ACTRIS Data Centre*

During the ACTRIS implementation phase (expected 2020-2024), the Central Facilities will be constructed and their services tested. ACTRIS operations will start step-by-step by ramping up the service provision. After the necessary legal preparations, ACTRIS shall become a legal entity (ERIC, European Research Infrastructure Consortium) funded by the Member countries. The target is to launch ACTRIS ERIC in the beginning of 2021. It is foreseen that ACTRIS will be fully operational by 2025. The ACTRIS Central Facilities host selection was a part of ACTRIS PPP, and the following consortium is selected to host the ACTRIS Data Centre, and the various units with services to data producers and data users.

### 1.1. ACTRIS data set descriptions and ACTRIS data levels

ACTRIS data are data from observational National Facilities and exploratory National Facilities complying with the procedures established within ACTRIS. The ACTRIS  atmospheric variables are listed in Appendix I, associated the corresponding
recommended methodology. ACTRIS data comprises ACTRIS variables resulting from measurements
that fully comply with the [standard operating procedures (SOP), measurement recommendations, and
quality guidelines](http://actris.nilu.no/Content/?pageid=2bedb8fc3d5a42a4b6d96d5fb8dfcd3b) established within ACTRIS.

There are 3 levels of ACTRIS data:
  * **ACTRIS level 0 data:** Raw sensor output, either mV or physical units. Native resolution, metadata necessary for next level.
  * **ACTRIS level 1 data:** Calibrated and quality assured data with minimum level of quality control.
  * **ACTRIS level 2 data:** Approved and fully quality controlled ACTRIS data product or geophysical variable.
  * **ACTRIS level 3 data:** Elaborated ACTRIS data products derived by post-processing of ACTRIS Level 0 -1 -2 data, and data from other sources. The data can be gridded or not.
  * **ACTRIS synthesis product:** Data product from e.g. research activities, not under direct ACTRIS responsibility, but ACTRIS offer repository and access.

  Richard add here the figure I sent
![Architecture of the ACTRIS Data Centre](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actris/data-management-plan/master/DMP/img/ACTRIS_data_levels.jpg)
*Figure 1: ACTRIS data levels*

The list of variables are expected to increase during the progress of ACTRIS, particularly level 3 data products. During ACTRIS-2, e.g. the aerosol and cloud databases will be augmented with new classification products developed through the combination of existing sensors with additional instrumentation; and products providing information about aerosol layering and typing, together with advanced products derived from long term series or special case analyses. In addition, new parameters utilising these products will also be prepared, and standardized pre processed lidar data and NRT optical property profiles will be available.

## 2. Data summary for of the ACTRIS data centre

#### The purpose of the data collection/generation

The purpose of the data collection and generation of data products in ACTRIS is to provide open access to aerosol, cloud and trace gas in-situ and remote sensing measurements of high quality, benefiting a large community of scientists involved in atmospheric science and related areas as well as policy makers, the private sector, educators and the general public. See the [Stakeholder Handbook](http://www.actris.eu/Portals/46/Documentation/ACTRIS%20PPP/Stakeholder%20Handbook/high_res_version.pdf?ver=2018-06-04-080105-217) for more information.

#### The relation to the objectives of the project

Management of ACTRIS data relates to measuring atmospheric composition and the ability to predict the future behaviour of the atmosphere over all time scales. High quality observation data facilitates this and needs to be supported by:
  * Documentation of archiving procedures and access to level 0 -> level 3 data by the National Facilities (NFs), Topical Centres (TCs), and Central Facilities (CFs)
  * Centralized and traceable processing chain of level 0 data
  * Long-term archiving and preservation of ACTRIS level 1 to level 3 data and data products
  * Access to ACTRIS data, data products, and digital tools through a single point of entry, the ACTRIS data user interface
  * Documentation of data, data flow, citation service, and data attribution, including version control, data traceability, and interoperability,
  * Data curation and support for campaigns and dedicated research projects and initiatives, external or internal to ACTRIS.

#### Main users of ACTRIS data and software

ACTRIS will produce data and data products essential to a wide range of communities as decribed in the Stakeholder Handbook, including:

* Atmospheric science research communities world-wide (climate and air-quality, observational/ experimental/ modelling/ satellite communities, national and international research programmes and organisations);
* Environmental science research communities and communities from other neighbouring fields: hydro-marine, bio-ecosystem, geosciences, space physics, energy, health, and food domain, to study interactions and processes in across different disciplines;
* Instrument manufacturers and sensor industries for development, testing, prototyping and demonstration;
* Operational services, National weather services, climate services for model validation, weather and climate analysis and forecasting;
* Space agencies for validation and the development of new satellite missions;
* National and regional air quality monitoring networks and environmental protection agencies for air quality assessments and validation of air pollution models;
* Policy makers and local/ regional/ national authorities for climate and air-quality related information for decision making and policy development.
* Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) are both being run by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)
* Science community working on air quality, climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion issues

### 2.1. ACTRIS In situ data centre unit (In-Situ)

The In-Situ unit provides a data curation service for aerosol, cloud and trace gas in-situ data and inclusion of data in EBAS database.

#### The types and formats of data generated/collected
The ACTRIS In-situ data centre unit is supported by the [EBAS database infrastructure](http://ebas.nilu.no/ResourcesATMOS/AboutEBAS.pdf). In situ data submitted to ACTRIS need to be formatted in the EBAS NASA-Ames format (ASCII file) by the data originator, and there are exsisting instructions and templates for each instrument/group of instruments. [The EBAS NASA-Ames format](https://projects.nilu.no//ccc/tfmm/kjeller_2016/EBAS_Data_Format_2016-10.pdf) is based on the ASCII text NASA-Ames 1001 format, but contains additional metadata specifications ensuring proper documentation from the [EBAS-Submit documentation](https://ebas-submit.nilu.no/) website as well as tools for [file-generation](http://dev-ebas-file-generation-tool.nilu.no/) (*beta*) and [file-submission](https://ebas-submit-tool.nilu.no/).

Currently, work is being conducted with regards to providing data in the netCDF 4 format, making it compliant with the [CF 1.7 convention](http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/cf-conventions.html) and the [Attribute Convention for Data Discovery 1-3 (ACDD)](http://wiki.esipfed.org/index.php/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3).

### 2.4. ACTRIS trace gases remote sensing data centre unit (GRES)

The GRES data centre unit provides data curation service for reactive trace gases remote sensing data, added values products, standardized process for data submission and QC. Trace gases remote sensing data are necessary to monitor the evolution of atmospheric composition in relation to air quality, climate change and ozone depletion issues. 

#### Description of the ACTRIS-GRES unit
Trace gases remote sensing data produced are organized within one unique database and are issued from measurements using three types of instruments located at different observatory stations. The three types of instruments are:

-   FTIR: Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrometry,
-   UVVIS including UV-VIS zenith-sky or UVVIS ZS and UVVIS MAXDOAS (Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy  instruments),
-   LIDAR DIAL: Differential Absorption Lidar.

This database provides access to level 2b and level 3 data of trace gases profiles (O3) or columns (O3, C2H6, HCHO, NO2, NH3 …). The level 2b data are produced from the consolidation of level 2a data using quality assurance and quality control procedures.
The level 3 data are produced from level 2b data, trace gas profiles or columns, and correspond to monthly averaged climatologies as well as coincident data with satellite overpasses.

#### The types and formats of data generated/collected
The ACTRIS trace gases remote sensing data centre unit is supported by AERIS database. All providers will submit level 2 data following the GEOMS data format (Generic Earth Observation Metadata Standard, http://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/formats) and following the appropriate GEOMS template for FTIR, UVVIS and LIDAR measurements. The GEOMS data format allows the necessary requirements to setup the ACTRIS data curation service for trace gas remote sensing data.

The level 2 and level 3 data will be also converted in NetCDF ([https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)) version 4 format following the CF (Climate Forecast) conventions and be disseminated. The Climate and Forecast conventions are metadata conventions for earth science data. The conventions define metadata that are included in the same file as the data making the file "self-describing".

#### Re-use of existing data
The ACTRIS data user interface will include access to ACTRIS trace gases remote sensing data and legacy data resulting from ACTRIS pre-projects.

#### The origin of the data
The origin of the data is derived from instrument raw data, through offline observations.

### 2.5. ACTRIS Atmospheric simulation chamber data centre unit (ASC)

The ASC data centre unit provides atmospheric simulation chamber data services curation, provision and standardized process for data submission.
Atmospheric simulation chamber data contribute to better predict the behavior of the atmosphere over all time scales through a detailed understanding of the physical and chemical processes which affect air quality and climate change. Atmospheric simulation chambers are among the most advanced tools for studying and quantifying atmospheric processes and are used to provide many of the parameters incorporated in air quality and climate models. Furthermore, ASC provides access to detailed information on the infrastructures (i.e. simulation chambers) used for the generation of the data; this includes a technical description of the chambers (size, volume, walls, irradiation system …) and an “auxiliary mechanism” which provides the chamber-dependent parameters affecting the observations.

#### Description of the ACTRIS-ASC unit

The ACTRIS-ASC unit is structured in three pilars:

* The _Database of Atmospheric Simulation Chamber Studies_ (DASCS): This database provides access to level 2 data which are experimental and modelled data obtained from experiments in simulation chambers (exploratory platforms).

* The _Library of Analytical Resources_ (LAR): This database provides quantitative analytical resources that include infrared spectra, UV-visible spectra and mass spectra of molecules and derivatives. These data products (level 3) are obtained by processing of level 2 data.

* The _Library of Advanced Data Products_ (LADP): This database provides different types of mature data products (level 3) obtained by processing of level 2 data: rate constants of reactions in gas and condensed phases, quantum yields, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields, photolysis frequencies, mass extinction coefficients of aerosols, complex refractive index of aerosols, growth factors of aerosols and modelling tools.

#### The types and formats of data generated/collected

Level 2 data provided in the DASCS are approved and fully quality controlled time series of the targeted properties measured during experiments in simulation chambers. This quality control includes data gathering from different instruments and check for internal consistency and disregard of invalid data. Chambers characteristics, experimental protocol and metadata are attached. These data are produced by NFs and are made available in the DASCS pilar of the ACTRIS-ASC unit.They are provided within a standardized format which was developed during EUROCHAMP-2 project and which allows the distribution of common tools based on a common format. The EUROCHAMP data format (*.EDF) is based on an ASCII text format but contains additional metadata in a header. This format is intended to be easily readable by humans and by computer programs and is a compromise between strictly formatted binary netCDF files and the user defined xls or text files. Widespread programs like Excel and Origin cannot create netCDF and user defined files cannot be easily read into models or converted into emerging formats of the scientific community. The use of this format allows the easy application of routines and software that can be disseminated among partners and toward users. Tools for file generation (e.g. conversion into the EDF format) and on-line file submission are available for data providers. In addition, a library of scripts available in various programming languages (both commercial and free-access) dedicated to ACTRIS Atmospheric simulation chamber data handling is provided through the ACTRIS data user interface.

Level 3 data provided in the LAR are spectra (IR, UV-visible and mass) in JCAMP-DX format which is the standard format recommended by IUPAC for spectra. It is a 2D graphic format based on ASCII format. Metadata are attached and made available through the ACTRIS data user interface.

Level 3 data provided in the DASCS are of different types and have thus different formats. Most of them are provided as a unique value with metadata attached. These metadata include information on the level 2 data processing, a link to the level 2 data in the DASCS and the reference paper where this data has been published.

#### Re-use of existing data

The ACTRIS data user interface will include access to ACTRIS Atmospheric Simulation Chambers data and legacy data resulting from EUROCHAMP-2 and EUROCHAMP-2020 projects.

#### The origin of the data

Not clear for me what is expected here … Should we explain in details how data are generated?
*It  should be sufficient to just briefly describe where the data is coming from e.g. is it sensors,lab experiments, satellites etc.*

#### Data utility

ACTRIS-ASC unit will produce different types of data and data products essential to a wide range of communities.

* Level 2 data provided in the DASCS: These data are of high interest for a large community of users in atmospheric science research and related areas, as well as the private sector. In particular, they are largely used for modelling activities to develop and/or validate chemical schemes of atmospheric models.

* Level 3 data provided in the LAR: These data are of high interest for a large community of users in atmospheric sciences, analytical chemistry and related areas, as well as the private sector. Indeed, quantitative chemical analysis of infrared spectra for complex mixtures requires access to standards for the calibration of instruments. However, as the chemical species formed by these processes are often very complex (and not commercially available), their spectra are not available in the “classical” databases of analytical chemistry, or are not useful due to their low resolution. To tackle this issue, the EUROCHAMP consortium has developed its own Library of infrared spectra and has made it freely available to the scientific communities.

* Level 3 data products provided in the LADP: These data are especially useful for researchers working on atmospheric observations, as well as atmospheric model development and validation. It includes products for the development of chemical mechanisms in atmospheric models (e.g. rate coefficients, photolysis frequencies, SOA yields, vapor pressures, etc.), products for the retrieval of satellite data and for radiative transfer modelling (e.g.), and tools to generate oxidation schemes which are very useful to interpret field measurements as well as laboratory studies.

#### Outline of data life cycle (workflow and workflow diagram)

Detail on the data life cycle and workflow (workflow diagrams for data production) for Atmospheric Simulation chamber data can be found in annex 7.

### 2.6. ACTRIS data and services (ACCESS)

The access unit provides provision of ACTRIS web interface for data, services and digital tools as well as data production of selected Level 3 data, quality control tools, and synergy data products.
Data management of ACTRIS level 3 data relates to the ability to predict the future behaviour of the atmosphere over all time scales. This is facilitated by post-processed ACTRIS level 0-1-2 observations, advanced multi-instrument synergistic algorithms, long term reanalysis against model results and satellite data.

The ACTRIS ACCESS unit will provide elaborated aerosol, cloud and trace gas parameters, issued of advaced multi-instrument synergistic algorithms, long term reanalysis, modelling and satellite data and sources. The list of ACTRIS level 3 data products is detailed in the [Appendix II](https://folk.nilu.no/~richard/actris-ri-variables/Appendix_II_ACTRIS-RI_level3_variables_21February2018.xlsx).

#### The types and formats of data generated/collected

The objective is that most of the level 3 data generated will be in [NetCDF data format](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) and have metadata compliant to the [NetCDF CF Metadata Conventions](http://cfconventions.org). This format and metadata are widely used in the atmospheric science community, and is supported by a lot of standard visualization and analysis tools.
Nevertheless, the collected data can come from external sources and so, can be in non standard formats. In these cases, they will be rather kept in their original format.
Here is the summary of the collected/generated level 3 datasets:

## 3. Data Management at the ACTRIS data centre

**Describe briefly data management for each data centre unit. (Could we move this up to section 2 and include this as a part of the data summary for the data centre units)**

Data management is handled by the individual data centre unit:

* ACTRIS In situ data centre unit for all aerosol, cloud and trace gas in situ data - In-Situ
* ACTRIS Aerosol remote sensing data centre unit - ARES
* ACTRIS Cloud remote sensing data centre unit - CLU
* ACTRIS Trace gases remote sensing data centre unit - GRES
* ACTRIS Atmospheric simulation chamber data centre unit - ASC

Access to quality controlled data from the data centre units is provided by the ACTRIS data and service access unit (ACCESS). The ACCESS unit is not only responsible for access to measurement data, but also access to services, tools and providing documentation, all which is based on metadata provided by the data centre units. Currently there are 3 data centre units providing metadata (including details on how to access measurement data), this includes data from the Cloudnet (Cloud remote sensing) database, Earlinet (Aerosol remote sensing) database and the EBAS (aerosol, cloud and trace gas in situ data) database. The metadata is used as input to the current ACTRIS metadata catalog providing identification and access to data through the [ACTRIS data portal](http://actris.nilu.no/). Access to primary datasets are regularly updated through the metadata catalogue, typically every night or on a weekly basis, through various procedures, so potentially new data added to the topical databases are available through the portal the following day.

### 3.1. Findable: Making data findable, including provisions for metadata [FAIR data]

ACTRIS will harvest metadata from a large range of observations and methodologies provided by multiple data centre units covering different types of data both in terms of size, time coverage and metadata. The ACCESS unit will provide discovery metadata for all ACTRIS data, using a common standard that is WIS compliant such as ISO19139 or ISO19115. 

ACTRIS is providing metadata via its metadata catalog following the iso19139 standard harvesting metadata from the different DC units. Exceptions may occur in cases where current standards do not meet the need to describe data/metadata.

Below is a table offering an overview of the sources the ACTRIS DC is harvesting metadata from.

| DC unit                  | metadata service               | end-point                                                                               |                        standard |

Table: ACTRIS metadata for discoverability

Future efforts should make it possible for the ACCESS unit to harvest all metadata from the different data centre units and collect this in a central ACTRIS metadata catalog and provide this through a commonly used protocol for Metadata harvesting like OAI-PMH or similar.

There might be instances where standards does not cover the need for describing the data at the data centre unit. In this case, one should still try to provide metadata in a way that is similar to the agreed formats and standards and at the same time push for an extension of the specified standard.

The core responsibility of metadata provisioning is at the data centre unit level and common metadata protocols and standards for each data curation unit will be implemented. The role of the ACCESS unit is to harvest metadata records for the ACTRIS metadata catalog as well as putting in place instruments for monitoring data/metadata provisioning as well as monitoring and collecting user statistics (inspections, plotting and download of data) related to the ACTRIS Data Portal and the ACTRIS metadata catalog.

Generally, ACTRIS data set names aims to be compliant with [CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions](http://cfconventions.org/standard-names.html). In the case where no standard CF names are defined, an application will be sent to establish these.

ACTRIS works towards establishing traceability for all applicable variables using persistent identifiers (PIDs). This is to assure proper attribution is given to data originators adequately reflecting their contributions. Currently ACTRIS is using  digital object identifiers (DOIs) for all secondary datasets though the [Data Cite Metadata Store API](https://mds.datacite.org/).

Moreover, ARES unit assigns a persistent identifier to a dataset implementing an internal PID generation system based on an alphanumerical \<prefix\>/\<suffix\> pattern. 

Currently there is no search model used by the ACCESS unit (ACTRIS data portal). Still search keywords are implemented to varying degrees on the individual data centre unit level (e.g. search keywords are used for the EBAS ISO19115 records). The ACTRIS data centre should in the future use a controlled set of vocabularies for search keywords like [Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/gcmd/global-change-master-directory-gcmd-keywords) or similar, and semantic search will be implemented.

ACTRIS aiming at following the [INSPIRE](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32007L0002) directive for metadata formatting. Present standard(s) for metadata at the ACTRIS data and services access unit level. Must decide if data centre units should provide metadata according to a specific standards, as well as providing metadata from the ACTRIS DC to the ENVRI cluster, EOSC etc.

The ACTRIS DC aims at providing clear versioning of its data and metadata, due to the decentralised nature of the Data Centre, this varies between the different data centre units, and implemntaion will be done on unit level.

As a guiding principle, all data submitted to ACTRIS passing quality assurance should be uniquely identified. In case of updates, a ID-number is generated, and previous data versions should be identifiable and kept available upon request while the latest version is served through the ACTRIS data portal web-interface.

A Versioning System has been implemented at ARES directly in the RDBMS by using DML (Data Manipulation Language) triggers.
A new version of a file is produced when a user tries to modify data through a DML event. New versions will be centrally produced if new QC procedures and new processing features are released. Additionally new versions of the files will be allowed and centrally handled for fixing file bugs in particular for legacy data.

### 3.2. Accessible: Making data openly accessible [FAIR data]

The main access point to ACTRIS data will be through the [ACTRIS data portal](http://actris.nilu.no/), this will be a web portal that allows the user to search, analyse and download data produced within ACTRIS. Access to data and metadata should also be made possible by machine-to-machine interaction, enabling harvesting of metadata from the ACTRIS metadata catalog, for example setting up a ACTRIS OAI-PMH server.

The guiding principle is free and open access to data and data products.

There might also be data available through the ACTRIS data portal that is not directly ACTRIS data, but used in the interpretation of ACTRIS data.

**The following types of data are provided:**

* **Type 1: ACTRIS data**
   * Data are funded and produced within the context of the ACTRIS project. Every dataset created within ACTRIS is owned by the ACTRIS partner(s) who created this dataset, and the ACTRIS data policy can be found here. A description of ACTRIS data is provided in the "ACTRIS Data management Plan". This includes access to NRT data. The ACCESS unit is currently showcasing NRT data providing quicklook images for [Near surface and cloud data](http://actris.nilu.no/Content/?pageid=844fe06802f04a83a2d6b0e8b2a59fe2) and [Aerosol profiles](http://actris.nilu.no/Content/?pageid=ae1bf05f1fa54ba8bae735a2420e6c8d).

* **Type 2: Other data available through the portal**
  * Data are archived and owned by other organisations or data providers and are hosted at other databases. Type 2 data are provided with the permission of each organisation or data provider contributing to the data archive. Each dataset of type II may have its own data policy that will supersede the ACTRIS data policy.

* **Type 3: ACTRIS level 3 data:**
  * Data are elaborated ACTRIS data products derived by post-processing of ACTRIS Level 0 -1 -2, and data from other sources. The data can be gridded or not. Level 3 datasets are derived from measurement data, where the measurements are reported to the ACTRIS topic data repositories. The datasets are derived by e.g. averaging, filtering of events, interpolation of measurement data and are usually the result of analysis for special studies or processed for model experiments. The [secondary data archive](http://actris.nilu.no/Content/?pageid=226809f7a0ac49538914eeafb4448afa) stores secondary data sets to provide long term access for all users, including the possibility to issue a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Secondary datasets are normally not updated over time.

Still, individual data centre units will also serve as access points for ACTRIS data. But that is out of scope for this document.

General guidelines for access to ACTRIS data and services are available in the current [ACTRIS access and service policy](https://www.actris.eu/Portals/46/Documentation/ACTRIS%20PPP/Deliverables/Public/WP2_D2.6_M32.pdf?ver=2018-10-29-152442-467). Conditions of use should be indicated in section 3.4, and is covered by the attached licence, unless stated otherwise.

Some data requires a username and password in order to gain access, e.g. the usage of aerosol profile data.**(If some data is kept closed, we must provide rationale for doing so. For ARES registration is open to everybody.)**
Apart from Quicklooks (simple plots of data from the [In Situ](http://ebas-nrt-showcase.nilu.no/), ARES and CLU units), Near-Real-Time (NRT) data is mostly access protected.
For all data that requires username and password, a Single-Sign-On service should be implemented, and used by all Data Centre units.

A Single-Sign-On authentication system has been implemented at ARES unit. It is based on [CAS (Central Authentication Service)](https://www.apereo.org/projects/cas) protocol and provides both authentication via username and password and via Google credentials. 

In all cases where access is restricted, information on how to access the data should be available through the metadata.

If specific software tools are need to access the data, documentation about the software and how to access it should be included, preferably in the metadata. Furthermore, ACTRIS digital tools (software etc.) should be available through open access repositories like GitHub. A open source licence for software should be encouraged and applied when possible. The aformentioned guidelines are related to ACTRIS [level 2 data](#11-actris-data-set-descriptions-and-actris-data-levels). This is primarily intended as guidelines for software that is needed to access data that is available through the data centre. Software related to ACTRIS level 0 and level 1 data is out of scope for this section.

Below is an overview of licences that are associated with data from the different data center units in ACTRIS:

### 3.3. Interoperable: Making data interoperable [FAIR data]

Making data interoperable is the guiding principle of the ACTRIS DC. The ACTRIS DC handles a large variety of data and there is currently no common approach towards interoperability.

By some of the DC units the Thredds Data Server (TDS) is used for serving data as netCDF and through OPeNDAP (EBAS, Earlinet, others?). 

More over, ARES unit provides a [REST API](https://150.145.73.229/earlinetservice/services) for machine-to-machine communication. The API serves metadata (info, provenance, versions, quality controls, etc.) in JSON format and data (specific files or datasets previously generated) in NetCDF format. CLU unit provides a [RESTful API](http://devcloudnet.fmi.fi/api) with similar services (data and some metadata).

ACTRIS DC needs to specify what data standards the ACTRIS DC should choose, in order to facilitate interoperability. Still, work remains to see if a common solution could be agreed upon. The intricate nature of the data, might require the use of different solutions to suit the needs of each individual DC unit.

As mention in section 3.1 metadata standard and vocabularies commonly used in the atmospheric domain should be applied, unless the common solutions do not address the specific need for the DC unit.

Aerosol and cloud profile data are archived and provided by the ARES and CLU units in netCDF format. All published EARLINET and Cloudnet data are in [CF (Climate and Forecast) 1.7](http://cfconventions.org/) compliant format.


Implementation of new standards for data and metadata used in the context of ACTRIS should be discussed by all the DC units. This is especially important for the ACCESS unit, coordinating the access to all of the ACTRIS data. Therefore the aim should be to harmonize data and metadata as much as possible, both in terms of technical aspects related to implementation, but also making it easier for the end user to make use of the data.

Standard vocabulary might not always be used, but in all cases they should be mapped to standard vocabulary if existing by the DC ACCESS unit.

As an overarching goal, ACTRIS DC will take part in discussions that takes place in forums/groups such as ENVRI FAIR across the different environmental domains and strive to use cross-environmental standards and solutions in order to allow for inter-disciplinary interoperability.

Below is a list of data formats and examples:

### 3.4. Reuseable: Increase data re-use [FAIR data]

The ACTRIS DC will facilitate data re-use by providing free and open access to ACTRIS data following the ACTRIS data and access policy and the open research data initiative of the European Commission. As a result, the ACTRIS DC will implement one or multiple licences for all ACTRIS level 2 data and NRT data that is available through the ACTRIS metadata catalog. Furthermore, the ACTRIS DC might also consider issuing a licence on the use of metadata, in order to ensure the visibility of ACTRIS when large amounts of metadata is harvested by third party application/services. ACTRIS aims to implement a license from the time ACTRIS becomes an ERIC (probably end of 2020 or early 2021). Until ACTRIS has decided upon and implemented one or more licenses, the current [ACTRIS data policy](http://actris.nilu.no/Content/Documents/DataPolicy.pdf) will apply.

Several features have been implemented by ARES unit to ensure reusability and traceability. Just to mention a few: 
  * recording of files and datasets downloaded by users, as well as of research filters/keywords used; 
  * the use of a centralized and automated tool, the [Single Calculus Chain (SCC)](https://scc.imaa.cnr.it), for data processing. This allows a "traceable" reprocessing when a new version (of the data as well as of the tool) is available. More over, the processing suite could potentially be made available to others per specific processing needs.  

Similarly, the CLU unit has a centralized and automated processing chain, Cloudnet, ensuring reusability and traceability, which is also available via [open source](https://github.com/tukiains/cloudnetpy) for the community to use, evaluate and review.

Availability of data can vary between the different data centre units. As an example, in situ data is typically submitted on an annual basis, and are therefore available the subsequent year, but other data centre units may provide NRT delivery of data; in addition, there may be campaign-based data. ACTRIS legacy data should be kept available for users, but may have a different data policy to the current ACTRIS data policy. If this is the case, this information should be available in the metadata.

**Consider adding a table giving an overview of when data is made available, level 2, NRT, campaign data and how this differs among the DC units**

Data quality assurance is provided by the data submitter and national facilities, appropriate topical centre, and the appropriate data centre unit.

ACTRIS as a Research infrastructure is in its preparation phase, and is expected to be fully operational within 2025, aiming to provide open-access to data throughout the lifetime of the infrastructure.
